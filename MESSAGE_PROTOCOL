queuemaster -> all renderers

    { "command": "queuemaster online" }

renderer -> queuemaster

    { "command": "register",
      "hostname": <hostname>,
      "pid": <pid>,
      "threadid: <threadid>,
      "strategy": <strategy> }

"strategy" one of:
 * by_pct - distributes work based on current queue length at various zoom
   levels.
 * by_fixed_pct - distributes work based on total number of tiles at each
   zoom level.

queuemaster -> renderer

    { "command": "render",
      "metatile": <metatile e.g. "15/950/1235"> }

renderer -> queuemaster

    { "command": "rendered",
      "metatile": <metatile> }

renderer -> queuemaster

    { "command": "unregister" }

All renderer -> queuemaster communication should have the renderer's queue

The queuemaster also understands:

    { "command": "stats" }
